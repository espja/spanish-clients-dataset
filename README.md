## Dataset with errors and duplicates

This dataset has been generated for [master data management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management) purposes. It contains 10% of duplicated clients and a 20% error rate. Clients containing errors can have from 1 to 5 errors randomly. Each client's errors are stated at the *ERROR* column. 

## Dataset with errors, duplicates and siblings

A dataset was generated simulating that 5% of clients where siblings. This means they share some information like Last name and second last name, and in some cases the address and birth date.
